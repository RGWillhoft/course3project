The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

The following items are created (and submitted) for this project:

1. Two tidy data sets as described below.
2. A Github repository with the script for performing the analysis.
3. A code book that describes the variables, the data, and the transformations performed to clean up the data.
4. A README.md.

The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:
